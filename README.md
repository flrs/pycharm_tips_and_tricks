# PyCharm Tips & Tricks

Repository for the lightning talk at the San Diego Python Users Group meeting on 11/21/2019

## Exercises

For instructions on how to reproduce the tricks presented in the talk,
explore the [story_with_exercises folder](story_with_exercises/).

In that folder, every Python file contains detailed instructions on how
to reproduce what you I did during the talk.

## Presentation

I presented the data in the [story_for_presentation folder](story_for_presentation/).
It is the same that you will find in the previous folder, except that
it does not have the detailed instructions.
