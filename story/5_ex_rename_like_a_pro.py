"""Rename Like a Pro

Exercise:
The contents of the people_on_meetup variable look more like a zoo. Let's rename the following items:

    - variable "people_on_meetup" -> "animals_in_zoo"
    - class "Meetup" -> "Zoo"

To rename an item, put the cursor on the item you want to rename and then press Shift+F6 on Windows/Linux
or â‡§+F6 on Mac OS.
